> **ReactJS is a JavaScript library. This implies that you need a strong foundation in JavaScript to master ReactJS. In fact if you your fundamentals in JavaScript are strong then you can even learn other frameworks like Angular and Vue in a matter of weeks. ReactJS becomes very complex if you do not have a good grasp of JavaScript. Try VueJS for a simpler framework.**
